She said the most important skill you need to know to do her job is to be able to ",Verb8," around (a) ",Adjective3," ",Noun7,". She said it was easy for her to learn her job because she loved to ",Verb5," when she was my age--and that helps a lot! If you're considering her profession, I hope you can be near (a) ",Adjective6," ",Noun2,". That's very important!
